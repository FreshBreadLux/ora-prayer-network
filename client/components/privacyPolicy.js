      <text className="ebgaramond">
        We take precautions to protect your information. When you submit sensitive information via the app, your information is protected both online and offline.
        <br /><br />
        Wherever we collect sensitive information (such as passwords), that information is encrypted and transmitted to us in a secure way. Your password is never stored as-entered, but only as a securely hashed and salted reference.
        <br /><br />
        While we use encryption to protect sensitive information transmitted online, we also protect your information offline. Only employees who need the information to perform a specific job are granted access to personally identifiable information. The computers/servers in which we store personally identifiable information are kept in a secure environment.
        <br /><br />
        If you feel that we are not abiding by this privacy policy, you should contact us immediately via email.
